            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Sai Chandu Martha, a passionate and adaptable Information Technology graduate from JNTUH University College of Engineering, Jagtial. With a strong foundation in Java, OOPs, JDBC, SQL, HTML, and CSS, I am eager to apply my skills in the software industry and continuously grow as a developer.

I have worked on projects like an IoT-based accident prevention system using an eye blink sensor and an AI-driven underwater image enhancement tool using GAN algorithms. My technical toolkit includes Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub, and I thrive on challenges that push me to learn and innovate.

Beyond academics, I have gained valuable experience as a Voice Counsellor Intern and an NSS Volunteer, enhancing my communication and leadership skills. Certified in Java, SQL, and Git, I am always keen on expanding my knowledge and staying updated with industry trends.

I am excited to embark on my professional journey, contribute to impactful projects, and grow within a dynamic organization. </p>
